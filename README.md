# automated-BLAST
This python notebook is designed to facilitate and automate blast searches. 
Function: 1) you enter a list of gene names and create an URL list
          2) you go through the url list and fetch the corresponding protein ID from NCBI
          3) The protein IDs will be used as template for the blast search
          4) the results of each blast search are stored in a separate .xml files
